ps.2-Simple Shell: The program is a straightforward shell implementation in the C computer language. It constantly asks the user to enter a command while running in a loop. Simple operations like ls and echo are supported, and the cd command can be used to switch directories. When a command is entered, the software starts a child process to carry it out. Once the child process has finished, it waits before prompting for another command. In order to make it simpler for the user to browse the file system, the application additionally displays the current working directory in the prompt. Essentially, the program offers users a clear and easy way to interact with their computer's command line interface.
