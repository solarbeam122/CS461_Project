# CS461_Project
For this course, you will need to work individually on a semester-long project that is divided and implemented into manageable phases. The goal of this project is to familiarize you with some of the system programs used in running an interactive environment, known as a "shell". Whenever you log into a UNIX computer, the system runs a program for you called a shell. You know this from the "%" prompt. When you type in unix commands like "ls", the shell executes the program for you.
For this project, you need to implement a program that serves as a shell interface program that performs rudimentary shell actions. Your program should accept user commands and then execute each command in a separate process. To do that, your implementation must utilize the UNIX fork(), exec(), wait(), dup2(), and pipe() system and support input and output redirection and pipes as a form of Inter Process Communication between a pair of commands.
